# hack.chat

[hack.chat](https://hack.chat/) is a minimal, distraction-free, accountless, logless, disappearing chat service which is easily deployable as your own service. The current client comes bundled with LaTeX rendering provided by [KaTeX](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX) and code syntax highlighting provided by [highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js).

A list of software developed for the hack.chat framework can be found at the [3rd party software list](https://github.com/hack-chat/3rd-party-software-list) repository. This includes bots, clients, docker containers, etc.

This is a backwards compatible continuation of the [work by Andrew Belt](https://github.com/AndrewBelt/hack.chat). The server code has been updated to ES6 along with several new features including new commands and hot-reload of the commands/protocol. There is also [documentation](documentation/DOCUMENTATION.md) and a [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

# Contributing

- If you are modifying commands, make sure it is backwards compatible with the legacy client and you update the documentation accordingly.
- Use [the template](documentation/templateCommand.js) to learn how to create new commands.
- Use two space indents.
- Name files in camelCase.
- Scripts that do not default to strict mode (such as modules) must use the `'use strict'` directive.
